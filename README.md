Features
Addition (+): Adds two numbers.

Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.

Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.

Division (/): Divides the first number by the second, with a built-in check to prevent division by zero.

Continuous Operation: The program runs in a loop, allowing you to perform multiple calculations without restarting.

User-Friendly Interface: Prompts the user for input and displays clear results.

Exit Functionality: Type 'exit' at any time to quit the program.

Usage: Follow the on-screen prompts to enter two numbers and the desired operation.

Code Overview
The program is structured with a main method that handles user input using the Scanner class and controls the main loop. Separate static methods are created for each arithmetic operation, which makes the code clean and easy to read.

add(double a, double b): Returns the sum of a and b.

subtract(double a, double b): Returns the difference between a and b.

multiply(double a, double b): Returns the product of a and b.

divide(double a, double b): Returns the quotient of a and b, assuming b is not zero
